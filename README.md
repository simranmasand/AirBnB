## Project Objective(s)

#### Description
Our final project asks you to apply your skills to a business problem of your choice. The capstone is an opportunity for you to demonstrate your new skills and tackle a pressing issue relevant to your team, division, or organization. Youâ€™ll generate a hypothesis, analyze internal data, and generate a working model, prototype, solution, or recommendation.

#### Deliverables
Final project deliverables include:

- **Project Proposal**: Describe your chosen problem and whether you have access to relevant data.
- **Project Brief**: Share a brief summary of your initial analysis and next steps in order to get assistance from your instructional team.
- **Technical Notebook**: Submit a cleanly formatted Jupyter notebook (or other files) documenting your code and process for technical/peer stakeholders.
- **Presentation**: Present a summary of your business problem, approach, and recommendation to an audience of non-technical executive stakeholders.
